# Employee Tracker ![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=ISC&message=license&color=red)


## Description 
I have created a command line Employee Tracker database designed  to be used in an office environment. This application allows a manager to easily keep track of all employees, departments, roles, and various other information. The manager may add, view, sort, and update employees by folowing the command line prompts.
